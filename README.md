# algorithms_course
A homework repository on "Non-numerical programming algorithms" of MSU Physcics Faculty.
Here matplotlibcpp is used to visualize perfomance of algorithms. Thanks to https://matplotlib-cpp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ and https://github.com/lava/matplotlib-cpp.
Keep in mind that the code is not commented and might be not understandable sometimes, it was for personal use and I didn't have any time to make the code clean and organized.
Geeks for Geeks (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) articles were used as a helping hand for writing the algorithms.

Task 1 is an implementation of Rabin-Karp search algorithm.

Task 2 is an implementation of Quick Sort algorithm.

Task 3 is an implementation of Merge sort and Bucket sort algoritms.

Task 4 is an implementation of Bitonic sort.

Task 5 is a solution to stable marriage problem. Has sulotions with O(n!) and O(n^2) complexity.

Task 6 is an AVL Tree implementation.

Task 7 is a Hash Table implementation with PJW hash.
